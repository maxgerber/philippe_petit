        <p>Phillipe Petit was a criminal, but his goals diverged from that of most criminals.
        His aim was <strong>emotion</strong>. He gave joy back to cities which could so often seem
        lifeless and unnurturing to the communities that inhabited them. Petit championed
        beauty and playfulness for its own sake; his acts symbolised freedom from the humdrum of the everyday.
        He was escapism dancing on the rooftops, a renegade, an embodiment of passion so
        consuming that it determines the direction of a life. This is why I find him inspiring.</p>
